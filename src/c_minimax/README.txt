We implemented hashing and symmetric insertions. 
Our code can be found on the following github repo:
https://github.com/ThomasHaugh/TiA-TicTacToe-Group3

A good description of the process in which we modified the code is 
located in the commit page of the github repo. From my understanding, Thomas 
contributed up to the eighth commit 
(commit 94786fcff3ff0b3496ea4c33f808e945f4a72cf3). Vinuska 
then integrated Thomas's and his version. I wiped the directory and 
then posted this combination on commit 11 (commit 
2ae526db5828cd4c0ee271499aa43f6bd939db99). The rest of the changes I made with
the exception of the last commit as of march 30th. All later commits were made
after the posting of this assignment. 

When I ran the code on my laptop, set the player 1 strategy to StrtgyA and 
played 2 games I got the following output:
